### 1. What the "Other" Audio Code Does

In file tree, the peripheral folder contains the hardware necessary to turn numbers into signals.

* **`audio_pwm.sv` (The Translator):** This module takes the 8-bit digital number (0–255) generated by your CPU and converts it into a high-speed digital pulse. As seen in your waveform, it uses an internal `audio_counter` to determine how long the output pin should stay "High" versus "Low."
* **`audio_soc_top.sv` (The Interconnect):** This is the "motherboard" of your chip. It physically wires the CPU's memory output (at address `0x400`) directly to the input of the PWM engine.
* **`timer.sv` (The Metronome):** This ensures the audio code runs at the correct frequency (e.g., 44.1kHz). Without it, the "other" code wouldn't know when to ask the CPU for a new sample.

### 2. Why Use PWM

You might wonder why we don't just send the number directly to a speaker. Digital chips like your RISC-V SoC can only speak in **binary**: they are either at 0V (OFF) or 1.2V/3.3V (ON). They cannot naturally output "halfway" voltages (like 0.6V) needed for audio waves.

**PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** is a clever trick to solve this:

* **Simulating Analog:** By switching a digital pin ON and OFF incredibly fast (much faster than the audio itself), we can simulate different voltage levels.
* **Duty Cycle:** If the pin is ON 50% of the time, the speaker "feels" it as 50% volume. If it is ON 10% of the time, it sounds much quieter.
* **Cost-Efficiency:** Real Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) require complex analog circuitry and take up a lot of space on a silicon chip. PWM only requires a few gates and a single digital pin, making it perfect for low-power embedded SoCs like yours.

### How it looks in Project 
**Refer In output/6.Hardware_Multiplication_Verification.png**

1. **The CPU** finishes its multiplication and writes `0xFE` to memory.
2. **The `audio_pwm**` sees that `0xFE` and sets the `audio_pwm_o` signal to stay HIGH for almost the entire counter cycle.
3. **The Result:** If you were to plug a real speaker (with a simple filter) into that pin, you would hear a loud, clear audio tone.
